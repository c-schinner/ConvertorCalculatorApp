# Calculator Converter using Tkinter
The Calculator Converter using Tkinter is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python that allows users to perform unit conversions. This application employs the Tkinter library to create an interactive interface with radio buttons, labels, and a button for conversions.

# Features
Supports multiple unit conversion types, including mile to km, inch to cm, feet to meters, ounces to cups, and Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Provides real-time conversion as the user selects different conversion types and enters values.

Clear and intuitive interface for easy use.

Simple yet expandable structure for adding new conversion types.

# Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and the Tkinter library installed on your system.

2. Download or copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., calculator_converter.py).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.

4. Run the application by executing the following command:

        python calculator_converter.py

5. The application window will appear with radio buttons for different conversion types and an input field to enter the value you want to convert.

6. Select a conversion type using the radio buttons.

7. Enter the value you want to convert in the input field.

8. The converted value will be displayed in a label below the input field as you make your selection or enter values.

9. To exit the application, simply close the application window.

# Example

User selects "Mile to Km" radio button.

User enters value "5" in the input field.

The application displays "5 miles is equal to 8.05 km."

# Customization and Extensibility
To add more conversion types, you can follow the pattern used in the code.

Add new radio buttons and functions for the conversion logic. 

You'll need to modify the button_convert function to handle the new conversions and update the labels accordingly.

Feel free to modify the appearance of the GUI elements, such as font styles, sizes, colors, and layout, to match your preferences.

# Note
This application is designed for educational purposes and as a demonstration of GUI programming using Tkinter.

It does not cover all possible unit conversions and is not meant for real-world applications.

The provided code does not include error handling or input validation. 

In a production setting, you would want to implement proper error handling to ensure the application handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
